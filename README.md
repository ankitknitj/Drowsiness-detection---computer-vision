# Drowsiness-detection---computer-vision
In this project, Blink detection implementation in dlib libray is used to determine how long a given person’s eyes have been closed for. If there eyes have been closed for a certain amount of time, we’ll assume that they are starting to doze off and play an alarm to wake them up and grab their attention.
